   <body><p>Steps to completion: Research, Ideation, Prototyping and Design.<Br>
    The original desire to create a project such as this was figuring how to bond various individuals.<Br>
     I went through four various research methods such as user interviews, Fly-on-the-wall <Br>observation, unmoderated diary,
     and a survey on individual's gaming habits and physical creations.<Br> I was able to gain enough insight 
     from my data to lead me into understanding while people want to bond,<Br> it is heavily dependent on schedules, mood, energy and interests.</p>
    <p> The Problem: People of all ages need to experience socialization and leisure <br> with others in ways that match their schedules, mood, energy and interests<br>because it positively impacts their quality of life and bonding/relationships</p>
    <p>The Solution: An app that helps users find leisure activities.<br> It includes a leisure generator for activity ideas. Users can buy kits <br>for their activities or explore other interests.The app also offers mini-games<br>to play with friends or challenging others users on Pastime.</p>
