<p> The Problem: People of all ages need to experience socialization and leisure <br>
    with others in ways that match their schedules, mood, energy and interests 
    because it positively impacts their quality of life and bonding/relationships</p>
<p>The Solution: An app that helps users find leisure 
    activities. It includes a leisure
    generator for activity ideas.
    Users can buy kits for their 
    activities or explore other interests.
     The app also offers mini-games to
     play with friends or challenging 
    others users on Pastime.</p>
<p>Steps to completion: Research, Ideation, Prototyping and Design.<Br>
The original desire to create a project such as this was figuring how to bond various individuals.
 I went through four various research methods such as user interviews,Fly-on-the-wall observation, unmoderated diary,
 and a survey on individual's gaming habits and physical creations. I was able to gain enough insight 
 from my data to lead me into understanding while people want to bond, it is heavily dependent on schedules, mood, energy and interests.</p>
